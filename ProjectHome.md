A factoid Question Answering System for Amharic Language.
It is a desktop application based on Lucene 2.4. developed as a side product of my M.Sc Thesis work at Addis Ababa University Supervised by Dr. Mulugeta Libsie.

The project contains a Lucene Index files for fast test and some text file for indexing. Users are encouraged to create thier own index, modify the source code and so on.

You are interested to read the theoretical aspect of the system, a paper is included under the papers folder.
